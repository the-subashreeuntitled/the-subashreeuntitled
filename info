##Use the following Python code to read the JSON data from the file and store it in a dictionary named ex5

import json

# Read the JSON data from the file
with open("ex5.json", "r") as file:
    ex5 = json.load(file)

#Add the "Coffee" batter for the "Old Fashioned" donut in the dictionary ex5
# Add the new batter
ex5["batters"]["batter"].append({
    "id": "1005",
    "type": "Coffee"
})
##Overwrite the contents of the "ex5.json" file with the updated data:
# Write the updated JSON data back to the file
with open("ex5.json", "w") as file:
    json.dump(ex5, file)
